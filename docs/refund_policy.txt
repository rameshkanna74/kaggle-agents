# Refund Policy

## General Policy
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions. If you are not satisfied with our service, you can request a full refund within the first 30 days of your initial purchase.

## Pro Plan Refunds
- Pro Plan users are eligible for a prorated refund if they cancel mid-cycle after the initial 30-day period.
- The refund amount is calculated based on the remaining unused days in the billing cycle.

## Enterprise Plan Refunds
- Enterprise subscriptions are governed by the specific terms in the signed contract.
- Generally, Enterprise plans are non-refundable unless there is a breach of SLA.

## Non-Refundable Items
- One-time setup fees are non-refundable.
- Add-on services (e.g., dedicated support hours) are non-refundable once used.

## How to Request a Refund
